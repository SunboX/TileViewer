TileViewer
===

A Mootools 1.2.1 based Tile Viewer.

Can be used to develop a Patterngenerator.

You can set a background image and tell the generator how often it should be tiled. Now if you drag one tile all the others will follow. 	
This makes it easy to find matching edges. If youre done, you can get the coordinates of your positioned background image.
